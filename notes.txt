- looked at the pipes
- they exist in the disk
- tail does not open the disk entity, satys it is a socket

So:

- make a function to make a random str

issue #3
The ipc pipe names are hardcoded. So only one instance can run

test if this is true.
- ran ppipes.py in 2 terminals
- strange failures::

    sleeptime=0.1
    running item: 0, in worker: 1
    ****ERROR**** wait_add_mult() argument after * must be an iterable, not int
    ****ERROR**** above error while running item: 0, in worker: 1
    sent result of item: 0, in worker: 1 to sink

try again
Which one broke - the 1st or the 2nd:
1st broke::

    running item: 0, in worker: 2
    ****ERROR**** wait_add_mult() argument after * must be an iterable, not int
    ****ERROR**** above error while running item: 0, in worker: 2
    sent result of item: 0, in worker: 2 to sink

try again:

2nd did not run at all::

This is weird as shit. I was expecting a pip clash (like a port clash)
ha ! something else is happening. Worth exploring
- try running something simpler with same pipes

----------

- got ipython notebook to go into sphinx
- figured out how to squash commits in git
    - https://www.internalpointers.com/post/squash-commits-into-one-git
- Maybe worth having origin in bitbucket - so all the experiments don't get exposed

- put in bitbucket - so it is safe
    - clean up enough so that a releas is possible
    - put this pack in index.rst
        -    tutorial_docs/index
- move to github-pyenergyplus
- fork to santoshphilip
- release to pypi
- release to readthedocs
