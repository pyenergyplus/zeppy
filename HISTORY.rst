fixed issue #6

:Problem: tutorials are not running when using python3.10 in jupyter notebook
:Solution: updated the tutorial so that they work with python3.10

Details:

- running jupyter notebook is like running the code in an interpreter.
- multiprocessing is not able to run functions defined in the interpreter such as `waitsome`
- These functions are also defined in ppipes.py They can be imported from ppipes and then the tutorial runs without any problems.
- For some reason, this issue kicked in with python3.10
